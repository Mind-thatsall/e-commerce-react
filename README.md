# E-Commerce Project

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a full fledge (or close enough) e-commerce web app in about 2 weeks-1 month. This repository concerns the Front-End of this project while the Back-End is in PHP (Symfony 5) in another repository, the repositories for the back-end is not mine and private so I can't link it as of now but I made basic SQL queries and triggers, implemented Stripe sessions, webhook and refresh token/access token that are httpOnly.
